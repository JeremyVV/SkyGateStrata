|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Indoor unit (FTX12AXVJU)    | Unit Owner     | Clean filters, maintain airflow, control seasonal settings              |
| Wired Controller (BRC944B2) | Unit Owner     | Operate and monitor daily/seasonal use                                  |
| Outdoor unit (condenser)    | Strata         | Mechanical servicing, refrigerant checks, major repairs                 |
| Line set / refrigerant piping | Shared / Strata | Maintain insulation, monitor for leaks, HVAC service coordination       |

## 3. Seasonal Settings and Operation

### Heating Season (Late October – Late April)
**Goal:** Avoid cold recovery in the mornings & maintain comfort after afternoon cool-down.

| Timer | Start  | End    | Setpoint | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Morning Warm-Up** | 05:30 | 09:00 | 21 °C (or comfort temp) | Starts before sunrise; prevents morning chill. |
| **Afternoon Recovery** | 15:00 | 22:00 | Same as morning | Keeps space warm into evening; avoids all-night running. |

---

### Cooling Season (Early May – Early October)
**Goal:** Prevent afternoon heat buildup and allow overnight cooling.

| Timer | Start  | End    | Setpoint | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Morning Hold** | 06:00 | 09:00 | 23–24 °C | Maintains temp before day warms up; minimal morning load. |
| **Afternoon Pre-Cool** | 13:30 | 21:30 | Same as morning or −0.5–1 °C cooler | Preempts heat gain before it builds. |

---

### Fine-Tuning & Usage Notes
- **Setback limits:**  
  - Heating: ≤ 2 °C difference between active and inactive periods.  
  - Cooling: ≤ 1 °C difference.  
- **Inverter operation:** Daikin units run most efficiently when maintaining temperature rather than recovering from large swings.
- **Shoulder months:** In April/May and September/October, try using only the afternoon/evening timer to save energy.
- **Humidity & defrost:** In winter, avoid large overnight drops to reduce defrost cycles and temperature swings.

#### Quick Seasonal Changeover
| Season Flip | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Late April  | Switch to **Cooling Season** timers |
| Early October | Switch to **Heating Season** timers |

## 4. Indoor Unit Maintenance (Unit Owner)

Perform these tasks every 3–4 months:

| Task                        | Instructions                                            |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Clean air filters           | Open panel, remove filters, vacuum or rinse, dry fully  |
| Wipe louvers and surfaces   | Use soft damp cloth, avoid harsh cleaners               |
| Check airflow paths         | Ensure nothing obstructs intake/output                  |

## 5. Remote Troubleshooting & Error Codes

The Daikin **BRC944B2** remote can display stored error codes for the indoor/outdoor system.

### How to Retrieve Error Codes:
1. **Turn the unit OFF** with the remote.
2. **Hold the “Cancel” button** for ~5 seconds until “00” appears on the screen.
3. **Press “Cancel” repeatedly** to cycle through possible codes.
4. When the unit’s indoor section **beeps continuously**, note the code shown.
5. Exit check mode by holding **Cancel** again for 5 seconds or pressing ON/OFF.

If the remote is blank:
- Replace batteries with fresh, matching ones.
- Check polarity and clean contacts.
- If still blank, use **LED blink codes** on the indoor unit (refer to service manual or contact Strata).

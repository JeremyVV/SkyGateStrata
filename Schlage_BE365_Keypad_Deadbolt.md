## 5. Troubleshooting

| Lock won't turn | Jammed bolt or misalignment | Check door alignment and strike plate |
| Beeps but no action | Low battery | Replace 9V battery |
| Lock unresponsive | Dead battery | Replace 9V battery, reprogram if needed |
| Codes not working | Factory reset occurred | Re-add all codes |

---

## 6. Maintenance

- **Battery:** Replace 9V battery yearly or when beeps sound weaker.
- **Weather Protection:** Keep keypad clean and dry; avoid high-pressure washing.
- **Lubrication:** Use graphite or a dry Teflon-based lubricant on the bolt, **never oil**.
- **Code Review:** Remove old/unused codes periodically for security.

## 7. Security Best Practices

- Avoid obvious codes (e.g., `1234`, `0000`, or your unit number).
- Change codes when tenants or cleaners change.
- Do not share your Programming Code.
- Record Programming Code in a secure location.

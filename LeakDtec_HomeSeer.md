# Condo Smart Water Leak Protection System

This system protects your condo from water damage using leak sensors and automatic shutoff valves. It includes:

- ✅ **HomeSeer Smart Hub (LD-HS4Pi)** — connected to your internet router.
- 💧 **3 Leak Detectors (LeakDTec)** — placed under appliances or near plumbing.
- 🔧 **3 Automatic Water Shutoff Valves** — connected to a smart controller.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A **leak detector senses water** (e.g., from a pipe, appliance, or overflowing sink).
2. The **HomeSeer hub gets the alert**.
3. It **automatically closes the nearest water valve**, stopping the leak quickly.
4. You get a **notification by email or app**.

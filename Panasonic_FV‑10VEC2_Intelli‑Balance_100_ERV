# Panasonic FVâ€‘10VEC2 Intelliâ€‘Balanceâ€¯100 ERV

An Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV) is a ventilation system that helps keep the air in your home fresh, healthy, and comfortable while saving energy. It works by bringing in fresh outdoor air and exhausting stale indoor air at the same time, but before the two air streams leave and enter your home, they pass through a special core that transfers heat and moisture between them. This means in winter, the ERV captures warmth and humidity from the air youâ€™re expelling and uses it to preâ€‘warm and humidify the incoming cold, dry air; in summer, it helps keep excess heat and humidity out. The result is better indoor air quality, less stuffiness, and lower heating or cooling costs compared to simple exhaust fans or open windows.

## 1. Timing & Airflow Setup

#### Settings for a 980â€¯sqâ€¯ft unit
| Season | Size (Sq Ft) | # People |Timer (min/hr)  | Supply Air (CFM) | Exhaust Air (CFM) | Comments |
|--------|--------------|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
|Summer  | 980          |    1     | 10 | 50 | 50 | Keeps pressure neutral, increase exhaust if odors are an issue. |
|Summer  | 980          |    2     | 20 | 60 | 60 | Keeps pressure neutral, increase exhaust if odors are an issue. |
|Summer  | 980          |    3     | 30 | 70 | 70 | Keeps pressure neutral, increase exhaust if odors are an issue. |
|Winter  | 980          |    1     | 20 | 60 | 50 | Keeps pressure postive to prevent drafts, increase exhaust if odors or moisture are an issue. |
|Winter  | 980          |    2     | 30 | 70 | 60 | Keeps pressure postive to prevent drafts, increase exhaust if odors or moisture are an issue. |
|Winter  | 980          |    3     | 40 | 80 | 70 | Keeps pressure postive to prevent drafts, increase exhaust if odors or moisture are an issue. |

## 2. Maintenance & Consumables

### ðŸ”§ Schedule

| Interval | Tasks |
|---|---|
| Every **2â€“3 months** | Vacuumâ€‘clean both Return Air (RA) and Outside Air (OA) filters with softâ€‘brush attachment |
| Every **90 days** | Inspect supply (OA) filter |
| Every **6 months** | Replace OA (white paper) filter (MERVâ€¯8 or MERVâ€¯13) â€” FVâ€‘FL0810VE1 / FVâ€‘FL1310VE1 |
| As needed | Vacuum and clean energyâ€‘recovery core |
| After cleaning/replacing filters | Press **Filter Reset Button** ~3â€¯s to reset buzzer/light |
| Winter/cold conditions | Remove condensation via 4 plugs before maintenance |

### Consumable Parts
- **OA (white paper) filter**: FVâ€‘FL0810VE1 (MERVâ€¯8), FVâ€‘FL1310VE1 (MERVâ€¯13)
- **RA (black resin) filter**: internal, washable (vacuum only)
- **Energyâ€‘recovery core**: patented capillary core with antiâ€‘mold â€” clean via soft vacuum

### Spare Parts List
Several OEM parts available (filters, dampers, fans, PCB, etc.) â€” see official Panasonic parts list for FVâ€‘10VEC2.

## 3. User & Maintenance Notes
- **Routine maintenance mandatory** every 2â€“3 months â€” clogged filters may cause condensation/operational issues.  
- **Safety**: Always power off main switch before maintenance; use gloves; avoid water and solvents.  
- Filters: arrow on OA filter must align with airflow direction; RA filter convex side orientation matters.  
- **Buzzer**: notifies filter servicing at 90â€‘day mark. Silence by holding reset ~3â€¯s.  
- **Staticâ€‘pressure ports**: Access panel provides ports to balance supply/exhaust via pressure measurements.

## 4. Summary

1. **Set airflow & timer**: Use ASHRAE formula 
2. **Clean filters** every 2â€“3 months  
3. **Replace OA filter** every 6 months  
4. **Clean core** as needed  
5. **Reset filter indicator** after each service  
6. **Use boost** for shortâ€‘term highâ€‘airflow  
7. Expect **defrost cycles** in cold weather  
8. **Safety**: power down first, use gloves, no chemicals
